// Task to complete in JavaScript code:
// 1.We need to create one array of objects containing data for each learner in this course.
// Each object will represent the learners id: 125 and id: 132.
// 2.Each object needs to contain the following information: id., weighted average score (percentage),
// a dictionary of assignment IDs as keys, with both percentage scores as values.
// 3.We will Exclude assignments not yet due. If an assignment is not yet due, do not include it in the results or the average.
// 4.If an AssignmentGroup does not belong to its course (mismatching course_id), your program should throw an error, letting the user know that the input was invalid.
// 5.You should also account for potential errors in the data that your program receives. What if points_possible is 0? You cannot divide by zero.
// 6.What if a value that you are expecting to be a number is instead a string? Use try/catch and other logic to handle these types of errors gracefully.
// 7.Additionally, if the learner’s submission is late (submitted_at is past due_at), deduct 10 percent of the total points possible from their score for that assignment.
// 8.Create a function named getLearnerData() that accepts these values as parameters, in the order listed:
// (CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission]), and returns the formatted result, which should be an array of objects as described above.
